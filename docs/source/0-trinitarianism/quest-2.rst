Quest 2 - Sigma Types
*************************

We are still trying to express and "prove" the statement

.. admonition:: The statement

   There exists a natural that is even.

We will achieve this by the end of this quest.

Part 0 - Existence / Dependent Pair / Total Space of Bundles
============================================================

Recall from :ref:`quest1DependentTypes`
that we defined ``isEven``.
What's left is to be able write down "existence".
In maths we might write

.. code::

   ∃ x ∈ ℕ, isEven x

which in ``agda`` notation is

.. code::

   Σ ℕ isEven

This is called a *sigma type*, which has three interpretations:

- the proposition "there exists an even natural"
- the construction
  "keep a recipe ``n`` of naturals together with a recipe of ``isEven n``"
- the total space of the bundle ``isEven`` over ``ℕ``,
  which is the space obtained by putting together all the fibers.
  Pictorially, it looks like

  .. image:: images/isEvenBundle.png
     :width: 500
     :alt: SigmaTypeOfIsEven

  .. _totalSpaceAsSubset:

  which can also be viewed as the subset of even naturals,
  since the fibers are either empty or singleton.
  (It is a *subsingleton bundle*).

Part 1 - Making terms in Sigma Types
====================================

Making a term of this type has three interpretations:

- (giving a proof that there existence of an even natural amounts to giving)
  a natural ``n : ℕ`` and a proof ``hn : isEven n`` that ``n`` is even.
- pairing a recipe ``n : ℕ`` with a recipe ``hn : isEven n``.
- (giving a point in the total space is giving) a point ``n : ℕ`` downstairs
  together with a point ``hn : isEven n`` in its fiber.

Now you can prove that there exists an even natural:

- Formulate the statement you need. Make sure you have it of the form

  .. code:: agda

     Name : Statement
     Name = {!!}

- Load the file, go to the hole and refine the goal.
- If you formulated the statement right it should split into ``{!!} , {!!}``
  and you can check the types of terms the holes require.
- Fill the holes. There are many proofs you can do!

In general when ``A : Type`` is a type and ``B : A → Type`` is a
predicate/dependent construction/bundle over ``A``,
we can write the sigma type ``Σ A B`` whose terms are pairs ``a , b``
where ``a : A`` and ``b : B a``.
In the special case when ``B`` is not dependent on ``a : A``,
i.e. it looks like ``λ a → C`` for some ``C : Type`` then
``Σ A B`` is just

- the proposition "``A`` and ``C``"
  since giving a proof of this is the same as giving a proof
  of ``A`` and a proof of ``C``
- a recipe ``a : A`` together with a recipe ``c : C``
- ``B`` is now a *trivial bundle* since the fibers ``B a`` are
  constant with respect to ``a : A``.
  In other words it is just a *product* ``Σ A B ≅ A × C``.
  For this reason,
  some refer to the sigma type as the *dependent product*,
  but we will avoid this terminology.

.. code:: agda

   _×_ : Type → Type → Type
   A × C = Σ A (λ a → C)

``agda`` supports the notation ``_×_`` (without spaces)
which means from now on you can write ``A × C`` (with spaces).

Part 2 - Using Terms in Sigma Types
===================================

There are two ways of using a term in a sigma type.
We can extract the first part using ``fst`` or the second part using ``snd``.
Given ``x : Σ A B`` there are three interpretations of ``fst`` and ``snd``:

- Viewing ``x`` as a proof of existence
  ``fst x`` provides the witness of existence and ``snd`` provides the proof
  that the witness ``fst x`` has the desired property
- Viewing ``x`` as a recipe ``fst`` extracts the first component and
  ``snd`` extracts the second component
- Viewing ``x`` as a point in the total space of a bundle
  ``fst x`` is the point that ``x`` is over in the base space and ``snd x``
  is the point in the fiber that ``x`` represents.
  In particular you can interpret ``fst`` as projection from the total space
  to the base space, collapsing fibers.

For example to define a map that takes an even natural and divides it by two
we can do

.. code:: agda

   div2 : Σ ℕ isEven → ℕ
   div2 x = {!!}

- Load the file, go to the hole and case on ``x``.
  You might want to rename ``fst₁`` and ``snd₁``.

  .. code:: agda

     div2 : Σ ℕ isEven → ℕ
     div2 (fst₁ , snd₁) = {!!}

- Case on ``fst₁`` and tell ``agda`` what to give for ``0 , *``,
  i.e. what "zero divided by two" ought to be.

  .. code:: agda

     div2 : Σ ℕ isEven → ℕ
     div2 (zero , snd₁) = {!!}
     div2 (suc fst₁ , snd₁) = {!!}

- Navigate to the second hole and case on ``fst₁`` again.
  Notice that ``agda`` knows there is no term looking like ``1 , *``
  so it has skipped that case for us.

  .. code:: agda

     div2 : Σ ℕ isEven → ℕ
     div2 (zero , snd₁) = 0
     div2 (suc (suc fst₁) , snd₁) = {!!}

- ``(n + 2) / 2`` should just be ``n/2 + 1``
  so try writing in ``suc`` and refining the goal
- How do you write down ``n/2``? Hint: we are in the "inductive step".

  Try dividing some terms by ``2``:
- Use ``C-c C-n`` and write ``div2 (2 , tt)`` for example.
- Try dividing ``36`` by ``2``.

*Important observation* :
the two proofs ``2 , tt`` and ``36 , tt`` of the statement
"there exists an even natural" are not "the same" in any sense,
since if they were, ``div2 (2 , tt)`` would be "the same" as ``div2 (36 , tt)``,
and hence ``1`` would be "the same" as ``18``.

.. admonition:: "The same"

   Are they "the same"? What is "the same"?
