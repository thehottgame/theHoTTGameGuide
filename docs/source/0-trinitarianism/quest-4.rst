****************************
Quest 4 - Paths and Equality
****************************

If you have come here from :ref:`fundamentalGroupOfTheCircle`
then have a look at the :ref:`overview <trinitarianismOverview>`
to understand the philosophy of trinitarianism.

So far in :ref:`trinitarianism <0-trinitarianism>`
there has been no mention of "equality";
we have never said what it meant for two
types or two terms to be "the same".
However, in :ref:`fundamentalGroupOfTheCircle`
we *have* expressed what it means for two *spaces* to look the same,
by creating a path from one space to the next (usually by an isomorphism).
Indeed we will take this to be our *definition* of (internal) equality.

We will often adopt the geometric perspective,
but change perspectives when appropriate.

.. admonition:: Universe levels

   In the solutions we always use ``Type u``,
   but just write ``Type`` here.
   There is no conceptual difference with using
   an arbitrary universe,
   but in practice we want to be as general as possible.

   It is useful to stick to just using ``Type``,
   and realise why it is not general enough when problems arise.

Part 0 - The Identity Type
==========================

The construction
----------------

Given ``A : Type``  and  ``x y : A`` we have a type
``Id x y : Type``, called the *identity type* of ``x`` to ``y``.

.. code:: agda

   data Id {A : Type} : (x y : A) → Type where

     rfl : {x : A} → Id x x

The construction takes in (implicit) argument ``A : Type``,
then for each pair of points ``x y : A`` it returns a space ``Id x y``
with interpretations :

- ``Id x y`` is the proposition "``x`` equals ``y`` (internally)"
  and for every ``x``, we have a proof ``rfl x`` that
  "``x`` is equal to itself (internally)".
  (Hence the name ``rfl``, which is short for *reflexivity*.)
- The only recipe for the construction ``Id x y`` is given when
  ``x`` is the same recipe as ``y``.
- ``Id x y`` is the space of paths from ``x`` to ``y``, i.e. points
  in the space are paths from ``x`` to ``y`` in ``A``.
  For every point ``x`` in ``A``,
  there is the constant path ``rfl x`` at ``x``.
- ``Id`` is a bundle over ``A × A`` and the diagonal map ``A → A × A``,
  taking ``x ↦ (x , x)``,
  factors through ``Id → A × A``
  (viewing ``Id`` as the total space ``Σ (A × A) Id``).

Write this up in ``0Trinitarinism/Quest4.agda``.
We recommend you first try having
the explicit argument for ``rfl`` in ``rfl : (x : A) → Id x x``,
so you can see exactly what is going on,
but we will use ``rfl`` with an implicit argument
``rfl : {x : A} → Id x x``.

.. admonition:: Internal versus external equality

  In the first perspective use the word "internal"
  since there is also the notion of "external equality"
  that we want to distinguish.
  In short ``x`` and ``y`` are externally equal if
  the computer believes they are the same term,
  i.e. the string of symbols they simplify (normalise) to are
  exactly the same.

  If two terms are externally equal then they are internally equal,
  and the proof that they are internally equal is ``rfl``.
  However, having a proof ``p : Id x y`` is not enough for
  the computer to recognise ``x`` as the same term as ``y``.


Exercise - Symmetry
-------------------

For ``Id`` to be a good notion of equality it should at least be
an equivalence relation.
It is reflexive by having ``rfl`` in the definition.
We show that it is symmetric:

.. code:: agda

   idSym : (A : Type) (x y : A) → Id x y → Id y x
   idSym = {!!}

This has interpretations:

- Equality is symmetric
- We can turn recipes for the construction ``Id x y``
  into recipes for the construction ``Id y x``
- Paths can be reversed

Add this to the file ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4.agda``
and try showing it.
We give a detailed explanation in the hints and solution.

Assume we have a space ``A``, points ``x y : A`` and
a proof of equality / recipe / path ``p : Id x y``.
It may help to view ``Id x y`` as a construction
to think about how to proceed.

If you case on ``p : Id x y``
then you should see the following

.. code:: agda

   idSym : (A : Type) (x y : A) → Id x y → Id y x
   idSym A x .x rfl = {!!}

We interpret this as

- If ``x`` and ``y`` are equal by proof ``p``
  and we want to show something about ``x``
  ``y`` and ``p``, then it suffices to consider
  the case when they are externally equal;
  that ``y`` is literally the term ``x`` and ``p`` is ``rfl``.
- The only recipe we had for the construction ``Id x y``
  is ``rfl``, so we should be able to reduce to this case.
- To map out of ``Id``, viewed as a total space,
  it suffices to map out of the diagonal.

Since we have reduced to the case for when both points are ``x``,
we can simply supply a point in ``Id x x``.
There is an obvious one.

.. code:: agda

   idSym : (A : Type) (x y : A) → Id x y → Id y x
   idSym A x .x rfl = rfl

.. raw:: html

.. admonition:: The Geometric Perspective

   We have *not* included a justification via the geometric perspective.
   This is because intuitively it's not quite obvious that to map out
   of the space of paths it suffices to map the constant path.
   We justify the mapping out property geometrically
   in a :ref:`side quest <justifyingJ>`.

We can also make the relevant arguments implicit.
We will be using the following version from now on :

.. code:: agda

   Sym : {A : Type} {x y : A} → Id x y → Id y x

Exercise - Transitivity
-----------------------

In ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4.agda``, try to formalize (and then prove)
the following interpretations of the same statement :

- ``Id`` is transitive, which says if ``Id x y`` and ``Id y z`` both hold, then
  so does ``Id x z``.
- recipes for ``Id x y`` and ``Id y z`` can be made into recipes for ``Id x z``.
- paths can be concatenated

.. raw:: html

  <details>
  <summary>The statement</summary>

.. code:: agda

   idTrans : (A : Type) (x y z : A) → Id x y → Id y z → Id x z
   idTrans = {!!}

You may wish to make some of the arguments implicit.
We could also introduce notation that suggests concatenation:

.. code:: agda

   _*_ : {A : Type} {x y z : A} → Id x y → Id y z → Id x z
   _*_ = {!!}

We will use ``_*_``.

There are multiple ways of defining this.
Assuming ``p : Id x y`` and ``q : Id y z``
we could

- case on ``p`` and identify ``x`` and ``y``
- case on ``q`` and identify ``y`` and ``z``
- case on both ``p`` and ``q``, identifying all three

   p *0 rfl = p

   _*1_ : {A : Type} {x y z : A} → Id x y → Id y z → Id x z
   rfl *1 rfl = rfl

These three definitions will work slightly differently in practice.
We will use the first of the three,
but you can use whichever you prefer.

Exercise - Groupoid Laws
------------------------

The identity type satisfies some further properties,
which you can formalize then prove.
You may notice that they look almost like the axioms of a group,
except a bit bigger - for example there is not just a single identity
element (``rfl`` works at each point in the space).

Note that our solutions may differ to yours depending on
your choice of how to define transitivity / concatenation.
.. tip::

   If you are tired of writing ``{A : Type} {x y : A}`` each time
   you can stick

   .. code::

        private
          variable
            A : Type
            x y : A

- concatenating ``rfl`` on the left and right does nothing.

     *rfl : {x y : A} (p : Id x y) → Id (p * rfl) p
     *rfl = {!!}

  then it is equal to the original path.

     at the beginning of your ``agda`` file,
     and it will assume ``A``, ``x`` and ``y`` implicitly
     whenever they are mentioned.
     Make sure it is indented correctly.
     Beware that anything declared like this will be an
     *implicit argument*.

     We also recommend reading about the
     `module system <https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/language/module-system.html>`_

These axioms say that any type is a *groupoid*,
with the above structure.
This aligns well with the geometric perspective of types :
in classical homotopy theory any space has a groupoid structure
and any groupoid can be made into a space.

Recursor - The Mapping Out Property of ``Id``
---------------------------------------------

We may wish to extract the way we have made maps out of the identity type :

.. admonition:: Mapping out property of ``Id``

   Assuming a space ``A`` and a point ``x : A``.
   Given a bundle ``M : (y : A) (p : Id x y) → Type`` over the "space of paths out of ``x``",
   in order to make a map ``{y : A} (p : Id x y) → M y p``,
   it suffices to give a point in ``M x rfl``.
   This is traditionally called the "recursor" of ``Id``.
   (We have still not justified this geometrically.)

For example, in order to prove ``*Sym : {A : Type} {x y : A} (p : Id x y) → Id (p * Sym p) rfl``,
we would choose our bundle ``M`` to be ``λ y p → Id (p * Sym p) rfl``,
taking each ``y : A`` and ``p : Id x y`` to the space of paths from ``(p * Sym p)`` to ``rfl``
in ``Id x x``.
When we proved this in the previous section,
``agda`` figured out what ``M`` needed to be and just asked for a proof of the case
``M x rfl``.

In ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4.agda``, try formalising the mapping out property,
and call it ``outOfId``.

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   <details>
   <summary>The statement</summary>

.. code:: agda

   outOfId : (M : (y : A) → Id x y → Type) → M x rfl
     → {y : A} (p : Id x y) → M y p
   outOfId = {!!}

Note that we have used the symbol ``y`` in the type of ``M``,
but it really is just a local variable and will not appear outside that bracket.
We made the last ``y`` an implicit argument, since ``p`` contains the data of ``y``.

The proof is of course just casing on the path ``p``,
as we are trying to extract that idea.

.. _part1ThePathSpace:

Part 1 - The Path Space
=======================

If you came here from the quest on :ref:`fundamentalGroupOfTheCircle`
then you may be wondering why there has not been any mention of
the *path space* ``x ≡ y``.
The reason is that whilst ``≡`` and ``Id`` are meant to represent the same idea,
the implementation of ``Id`` is simple - we were able to write it down;
whereas the implementation of ``≡`` is "external",
and purely existing in ``cubical agda``.
In this part we will show that the two are "the same" as spaces i.e. isomorphic,
and after this we will only use ``≡`` for equality and paths
(as is the convention in the `cubical library <https://github.com/agda/cubical>`_).

We assert the following three axioms for the path space
(we will add another (univalence) in later):

- If ``x`` is a point in some space then ``refl`` is a proof of ``x ≡ x``.
- The mapping out property, called ``J`` :

  .. code:: agda

     J : (M : (y : A) → x ≡ y → Type) → M x refl
       → {y : A} (p : x ≡ y) → M y p

  This looks exactly like ``outOfId``.
- The mapping out property applied to ``refl`` :

  .. code:: agda

     JRefl : (M : (y : A) → x ≡ y → Type) (h : M x refl)
       → J M h refl ≡ h

  This says that when we feed ``refl`` to ``J M h`` it indeed gives us
  what we expect - something equal to ``h``.
  Unfortunately, though (given correct ``M`` and ``h``)
  ``outOfId M h rfl`` would *externally* be equal to ``h``,
  ``J M h refl`` is *not externally equal* to ``h``,
  but this is a ``cubical agda`` issue and not a HoTT issue.

Paths versus ``Id``
-------------------

.. admonition:: The goal

   Given two points ``x y : A``,
   the path type ``x ≡ y`` is isomorphic to ``Id x y``.
   We introduce isomorphism in
   :ref:`Quest 0 of the Fundamental Group arc<part2DefiningFlipPathViaUnivalence>`.

So we are trying to show

.. code:: agda

   Path≅Id : (x ≡ y) ≅ (Id x y)
   Path≅Id = {!!}

This involves a lot of small steps,
which we split up into hints.

.. Hint 0

To make an isomorphism we need to make maps forwards and backwards,

   Id→Path : Id x y → x ≡ y

To make the map forwards we will need to use ``J`` - the mapping

To map backwards we can use ``outOfId`` or just case on a path.

.. code:: agda

   Path→Id : x ≡ y → Id x y
   Path→Id {A} {x} = J {!!} {!!}

   Id→Path : Id x y → x ≡ y

Filling in what we have so far and extracting the relevant lemmas
we have

     rightInv : section (Path→Id {A} {x} {y}) Id→Path
     rightInv = {!!}

     leftInv : retract (Path→Id {A} {x} {y}) Id→Path

Since ``section Path→Id Id→Path`` will first take in ``p : Id x y``
we give such a ``p`` and case on it.
It should of course just turn into ``rfl``.

Since ``retract Path→Id Id→Path`` will first take in ``p : x ≡ y``
we directly use ``J``.

.. code:: agda

  Path≅Id : (x ≡ y) ≡ (Id x y)
  Path≅Id {A} {x} {y} = iso Path→Id Id→Path rightInv leftInv where

     rightInv : section (Path→Id {A} {x} {y}) Id→Path
     rightInv rfl = {!!}

   <p>
   <details>
   <summary>Hint 5</summary>

Checking the goal for ``rightInv`` we should see it requires a point in
``Path→Id (λ _ → x) ≡ rfl``, which is the same as ``Path→Id refl ≡ rfl``.
What's happened is ``agda`` knows that ``Id→Path rfl`` is just ``refl``
(they are externally equal), so instead of asking for a point of
``Path→Id (Id→Path rfl) ≡ rfl`` it just asks for a proof of the reduced version.
(In our heads we reduce ``(λ _ → x)`` to ``refl`` but ``agda`` does the opposite.)

We extract the above result as a lemma :

.. code:: agda

  Path→IdRefl : Path→Id (refl {x = x}) ≡ rfl
  Path→IdRefl = {!!}

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   <details>
   <summary>Solution</summary>

Since ``Path→Id`` uses ``J``,
the only thing we can do here is use ``JRefl`` :

.. code:: agda

  Path→IdRefl : Path→Id (refl {x = x}) ≡ rfl
  Path→IdRefl {x = x} = JRefl (λ y p → Id x y) rfl

.. Hint 6

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   <details>
   <summary>Hint 6</summary>

For ``leftInv``, giving the correct motive requires knowing what ``retract`` says.
It should look like

.. code:: agda

   leftInv : retract (Path→Id {A} {x} {y}) Id→Path
   leftInv = J (λ y p → Id→Path (Path→Id p) ≡ p) {!!}

Checking the goal we should see it requires a point in
``Id→Path (Path→Id refl) ≡ refl``.
It should be that we just can replace ``Path→Id refl`` with ``rfl``
using our lemma ``Path→IdRefl : Path→Id refl ≡ rfl`` -
but we haven't proven anything about paths yet!
Let us do so now : if ``f : A → B`` is a function (in our case ``Id→Path``)
then if two of its inputs are the same ``x ≡ y`` then so are the outputs,
``f x ≡ f y``.

.. code::

   cong : (f : A → B) (p : x ≡ y) → f x ≡ f y
   cong = {!!}

We can prove this directly using ``J`` or via ``Id``.
(We call it ``cong'`` to avoid clashing with the library's version)

.. raw:: html

  <p>
  <details>
  <summary>Solutions</summary>

.. code:: agda


   Cong : (f : A → B) → Id x y → Id (f x) (f y)
   Cong f rfl = rfl

   cong' : (f : A → B) (p : x ≡ y) → f x ≡ f y
   cong' {x = x} f = J (λ y p → f x ≡ f y) refl

   cong'' : (f : A → B) (p : x ≡ y) → f x ≡ f y
   cong'' f p = Id→Path (Cong f (Path→Id p))

.. raw:: html

  </details>
  </p>

From now on we will just use ``cong`` from the library,
but you can try to continue with your own version.
Now using ``cong`` we can define ``leftInv``.
Noting that externally ``Id→Path rfl`` is the same as ``refl``,
we just need to show that ``Id→Path (Path→Id refl) ≡ Id→Path rfl``.

Concluding that the two types are isomorphic is a good reason to accept them as "the same"
in the sense that if two spaces are isomorphic then they
share the same properties, because isomorphism should interact nicely with other constructions.
We expand upon this point in :ref:`part3Univalence`.

Part 2 - Properties of the Path Space
=====================================

In :ref:`fundamentalGroupOfTheCircle`
we assume a couple of results about the path space,
which we list here :

- The basics :
  We can make ``sym`` (the analogue of ``Sym``) and composition of paths (called ``_∙_``);
  we can show that paths also satisfy groupoid laws.
- We have already made ``cong`` in the previous part (in Hint 6).
- The function ``pathToFun`` which takes a path between spaces
  and converts it to a function between the spaces,
  following points along the path of spaces.
- The function ``endPt`` which follows a path along a bundle.

Some of these properties are what Homotopy Type theorists believe to be the
absolute minimal necessary philosophical foundations
for considering paths to be a good notion of equality :

- ``refl``, ``sym`` and ``_∙_`` give us that it is an equivalence relation
- ``cong`` tells us that any function respects equality.
- ``endPt`` and ``pathToFun`` approximately say
  that any predicate / family / bundle ``B : A → Type`` respects equality.

The Basics
----------

The direct proof of these are a good exercise on ``J``, or can be accomplished by
porting over results from the identity type using ``Path→Id`` and ``Id→Path``.
We won't go through each proof, but it is worth noting that since equalities tend
to be non-external, a little more work is required.
To see solutions for this, please see ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4Solutions.agda``.

Chains of Equalities
--------------------

Something that will help organizing the above proofs and work later on is a
notation for composition that suggests a "chain of equalities".
Let's say that we want to show that ``a + (b + c) ≡ c + (a + b)`` for naturals ``a b c : ℕ``.
Then classically one might write

.. code:: agda

     a + (b + c)
   ≡ by associativity
     (a + b) + c
   ≡ by commutativity
     c + (a + b)

In ``agda`` we would have both proofs of associativity and commutativity.
Let's call them ``ha`` and ``hc``
(in practice they would probably be something like
``+assoc a b c`` and ``+comm (a + b) c``).
Then using some cleverly defined notation, we can write in ``agda``

.. code:: agda

   example : (a b c : ℕ) → a + (b + c) ≡ c + (a + b)
   example a b c =
       a + (b + c)
     ≡⟨ ha ⟩
       (a + b) + c
     ≡⟨ hc ⟩
       c + (a + b)
     ∎

One you define ``_∙_`` for composition of paths,
you can get access to this notation
by including the following code.
Try figuring out why it works.

.. code:: agda

  _≡⟨_⟩_ : (x : A) → x ≡ y → y ≡ z → x ≡ z -- input \< and \>
  _ ≡⟨ x≡y ⟩ y≡z = x≡y ∙ y≡z

  _∎ : (x : A) → x ≡ x -- input \qed
  _ ∎ = refl

  infixr 30 _∙_
  infix  3 _∎
  infixr 2 _≡⟨_⟩_

All of this is included in the solutions file.

.. _pathToFun:

``pathToFun``
-------------

The function ``pathToFun`` (originally called ``transport`` in the ``cubical library``)
has the following interpretations :

- If two propositions are equal then one implies the other.
- If two constructions can be identified then we can transport recipes
  of ``A`` over to recipes of ``B``
- If two spaces look the same / if there is a path between spaces in the space of spaces
  then we can map one to the other
  (it turns out that we can make ``pathToFun`` always give us an isomorphism).

Try formalizing and defining ``pathToFun`` in ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4.agda``.

Since the only thing we know about ``J`` is how
it computes on ``refl``, we apply that :

   pathToFunRefl : pathToFun (refl {x = A}) ≡ id
   pathToFunRefl {A} = JRefl (λ B p → (A → B)) id

``pathToFun refl`` does at each point.

.. raw:: html

  </details>
  </p>


``endPt``
---------

The function ``endPt`` (originally called ``subst`` in the ``cubical library``)
has the following meanings :

- If ``B`` is a predicate on ``A`` and ``x ≡ y``
  are equal terms of ``A`` then ``B x`` implies ``B y``.
  "We can substitute ``x`` for ``y`` in the proof of ``B x``".
- If ``B`` is a family of constructions dependent on terms of ``A``
  and ``x ≡ y`` are identified recipes of ``A``,
  then recipes of ``B x`` can be turned into recipes of ``B y``.
  "We can substitute the recipe ``x`` for ``y`` in the recipe for ``B x``".
- If ``B`` is a bundle over the space ``A`` and
  we have a path ``x ≡ y`` between points in ``A``,
  then we can follow any "lifted path" starting at some ``bx : B x``
  to find its end point ``by : B y``.

.. admonition:: Predicates / families / bundles respect paths

   If we have a predicate / family / bundle ``B`` as above
   and an equality ``x ≡ y`` in ``A``,
   then we know that ``cong`` will give us an equality of *spaces* ``B x ≡ B y``.
   However, only in the presence of ``pathToFun`` is this equality any use -
   surely if two spaces are equal then we should be able to
   transport points from one to the other.
   Hence ``endPt`` / ``pathToFun`` (often both referred to as transport)
   justify the statement "predicates / families / bundles" respect paths.

Try to formalize and prove ``endPt`` in ``0Trinitarianism/Quest4.agda``.
Then show that it sends ``refl`` to what we expect.

.. raw:: html

  <p>
  <details>
  <summary>Solutions</summary>

One option it is a raw application of ``J``.

.. code::

  endPt : (B : A → Type) (p : x ≡ y) → B x → B y
  endPt {x = x} B = J (λ y p → B x → B y) id

  endPtRefl : (B : A → Type) → endPt B (refl {x = x}) ≡ id
  endPtRefl {x = x} B = JRefl ((λ y p → B x → B y)) id

We could also use ``cong`` and ``pathToFun`` as described above,
however due to size issues that we have not addressed in our
insufficiently general definition of ``cong``,
we have used the library's version of ``cong``.
(Outside this quest we will be using the library's version
of these definitions.)

.. code::

  endPt' : (B : A → Type) (p : x ≡ y) → B x → B y
  endPt' B p = pathToFun (cong B p )

Part 3 - Univalence
===================

Paths on Other Constructions
----------------------------

The path space tends to interact nicely with other constructions.
We give a list of examples here to demonstrate this point :

- For points ``(a0 , b0) (a1 , b1) : A × B`` in the product of two spaces
  we have that ``(a0 , b0) ≡ (a1 , b1)``
  is "the same" space as the product of path spaces ``(a0 ≡ a1) × (b0 ≡ b1)``.
  Formally we express "the same" using an isomorphism :

  .. code:: agda

     Path× : {A B : Type} (a0 a1 : A) (b0 b1 : B) → (_≡_ {A × B} ( a0 , b0 ) ( a1 , b1 )) ≅ ((a0 ≡ a1) × (b0 ≡ b1))

  where we have some kind of product of spaces (however you wish to define it).
  We give a proof of this in ``Quest4Solutions``;
  it is quite long but a good exercise in using ``J``.
- For points ``x y : A ⊔ B`` in the disjoint sum / coproduct of two spaces
  we have that the space ``x ≡ y`` is one of the four cases

  * If they are both "from ``A``" then ``x ≡ y`` is "the same as" the corresponding path space in ``A``
  * If they are respectively from ``A`` and ``B`` then ``x ≡ y`` is "the same as" the empty space
  * If they are respectively from ``B`` and ``A`` then ``x ≡ y`` is "the same as" the empty space
  * If they are both "from ``B``" then ``x ≡ y`` is "the same as" the corresponding path space in ``B``

  We go through this example in detail :ref:`here<classifyingThePathSpaceOfDisjointSums>`.
- If we have two functions ``f g : A → B`` then ``f ≡ g`` is "the same" space as
  ``(a : A) → f a ≡ g a``.
  This is called "functional extensionality".
  The HoTT proof of this is not straight forward,
  but in the :ref:`side quests <functionalExtensionality>`
  we will go through a cubical-specific proof,
  which is much simpler.

Univalence
----------

Now an important question arises from these considerations :

.. important::

  We have nice ways of describing what paths between points in constructions are,
  but what should paths in the space of spaces be?

Looking back on this quest (an perhaps one's life experience) we might think "isomorphism"
as it is our competing notion of "the same" for spaces.
The univalence axiom says something along the lines of this :

.. admonition:: Univalence

   If two spaces are isomorphic then they are equal.

   .. code:: agda

      isoToPath : {A B : Type} → A ≅ B → A ≡ B

   .. raw:: html

      <p>
      <details>
      <summary>Detail</summary>

   Actually univalence tends to refer to something slightly different,
   whilst this is a corollary of it.
   Refer to `The HoTT Book <https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/>`_ for more details.

   .. raw:: html

      </details>
      </p>

Hence any isomorphism we have shown can be upgraded to a path between spaces
in ``cubical agda``.
For example ``(x ≡ y) ≡ (Id x y)`` can now be shown.
